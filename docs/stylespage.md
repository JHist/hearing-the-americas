        <p>One of the most complex and troubling phenomena in the history of American culture, minstrelsy featured
            performers in blackface. Packed with songs, skits, political satire and dancing, minstrels shows were by far
            the most popular form of entertainment in the US from roughly 1830 into the twentieth century.</p>

            Montevideo, Uruguay during the late nineteenth century. Derived from Cuban and European sources that were
            reworked by Afro-Argentines and Afro-Uruguayans as well as their white imitators, the tango became
            enormously popular in Europe and the United States in the 1910s.</p>

        <p>The early record industry drew heavily on Vaudeville, and Vaudeville in turn depended heavily on ethnic
            humor, based in stereotypes about different nationalities. These comic skits range from good-natured to
            grossly offensive.</p>
